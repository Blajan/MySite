          <h3>Hi!</h3>
          <h4>My name is Blajan Razvan, I am 23 years old, I am Romanian and I am a person motivated, ambitious and persevering enough 
            to achieve my goals. I am the person who likes to get out of the comfort zone, because I know that area does not bring any 
            benefit and I am proud of that because that forces me to evolve.<br>In 5 years, and not only, I will be a very successful person, 
            working in a big company, doing what I like, sitting with the right people and growing every day.

          <h2>About me</h2>
          <h4>
            As I said, I am 23 years old, I am Romanian and I want to become a successful person.<br>             
            I am hungry to grow, to develop, I am hungry to enrich my skills.<br>In the last year I have rediscovered myself and found my way in life.
            I found that I like to learn, this fulfills me and makes me proud of myself.<br>
            I believe that when a person stops growing, that person is doomed to failure, and I do not accept being in that category.<br>
            I hate capping, I hate wasting my time, I don't want to be in an environment that doesn't force me to grow up, 
            I run away from such things and I think that this thing will bring me many benefits.<br>
            This would be a brief characterization of me. I hope I managed to arouse interest and I hope you will contact me to collaborate.

          <h4>
            From my point of view it is a pretty simple question due to the fact that I know why I am able.
            Why me? For the simple fact that I am hungry for evolution, for performance.<br> 
            I consider myself a serious, responsible, punctual man, eager to discover new things, 
            to constantly learn and to work as much as possible on myself and my mindset.<br> 
            I consider that I have the necessary qualities and skills to work in the IT industry.<br>            
            I don't consider myself a simple person, I don't want to go with the herd, I want to grow every day and fulfill my dream for which 
            I wake up early in the morning and go to bed late at night. 
            I am so mobilized to succeed that I can receive 1,000 refusals, I do not give up!!!<br>
            I seek success, I believe that anything is possible with a lot of work, dedication and perseverance and 
            I also consider that I demand these essential qualities.<br>
            I like to help people, this charges me and gives me the best mood.<br>
            Definitely if I were part of your company I would learn daily to be an important and basic person in your company.
            <br>I approach problems with the desire to solve them, I do not shy away from work, to learn new things, to be curious, 
            to get out of the comfort zone, because I know that this will help me in the long run and will make me getting better.
            <br>In conclusion, I think I would bring enough plus value to stimulate you to choose me in your team.
